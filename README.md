# OvernightDesk

**Your business never sleeps.**

Customer-facing web app for [OvernightDesk](https://overnightdesk.com) — a private AI assistant that handles support, operations, and reporting for solo entrepreneurs and small businesses in regulated industries.

## Current State: Waitlist

The site is live at **overnightdesk.com** with a landing page and waitlist signup. No auth or payments yet — that comes after Agent Zero is validated on the infrastructure layer.
