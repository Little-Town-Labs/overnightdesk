# Specification Quality Checklist: Titus TTS-Internal Channel MVP

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- The specification intentionally separates the single-channel conversational MVP from the existing channel-meeting transcript and recording pipeline.
- The next phase should resolve the exact Teams delivery and mention-routing seam while preserving the requirements and exclusions above; passive all-message RSC delivery remains deferred.
